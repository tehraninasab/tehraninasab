Hi! I'm Zahra, a curious mind who enjoys solving real world problems with creativity. Currently, I am a Master's student and researcher at MILA (Quebec AI Institute) and McGill University. I am working on Generative Modeling, Computer Vision and Vision-Language Foundation Models under the supervision of Professor Tal Arbel.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Sharif University of Technology. During this time, I completed a research internship at the VITA Lab at EPFL, where I worked on modeling uncertainty in human pose prediction. As part of a team of four, we developed a deep learning library called posepred, which integrates state-of-the-art pose prediction models, datasets, and evaluation metrics. I also interned on a food computing project under the supervision of Professor Ramesh Jain, where I gained hands-on experience with graph neural networks, transformers, and natural language processing. For my B.Sc. thesis, I worked on a Virtual Try-On project under the supervision of Professor Mostafa Kamali Tabrizi. This project gave me experience with generative models such as GANs, Conditional GANs (C-GANs), and teacher-student networks for knowledge distillation. I also worked with techniques in human pose estimation, inpainting, and optical flow.

Outside of research, I enjoy journaling and calligraphy. They give me space to reflect and observe the world from a clearer lens. I enjoy long walks with a good podcast and, occasionally, watching a good sci-fi movie.
